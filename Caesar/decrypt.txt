in the event of my demise
when my heart can beat no more
i hope i die for a principle
or a belief that i had lived 
i will die before my time
because i feel the shadow's depth
so much i wanted  accomplish
before i reached my death
i have come  grips with the possibility
and wiped the last tear from my eyes
i loved all who were positive
in the event of my demise!
